All of these examples satisfy the spec, but are increasingly shorter/better in terms of golf.

spec.txt          : the problem specification
golden.master.txt : I generated this ASAP so I could ensure that experiments matcth the spec
wc                : this Unix command is ideal for counting chars

Solutions, as I wrote them:

Simple.java : 173 chars
S.java      : 116 chars
T.java      : 113 chars
U.java      : 109 chars
